* Debugging with `debug` package

---

## âœ… 4. MongoDB Basics

* What is NoSQL? Why MongoDB?
* Documents vs Collections
* MongoDB installation or using MongoDB Atlas
* CRUD operations using MongoDB Shell
* MongoDB Compass (GUI tool)
* Database design: Embedding vs Referencing

---

## âœ… 5. Mongoose Fundamentals

* What is Mongoose? Why use it?
* Connecting MongoDB with Mongoose
* Creating schemas and models
* Schema types and options: String, Number, Date, etc.
* CRUD operations with Mongoose
* Mongoose query methods: `find`, `findOne`, `findById`, `save`, `updateOne`, `deleteOne`
* Model methods and statics
* Timestamps and versioning
* `.select()`, `.sort()`, `.create()` vs `.save()`
* Error handling with async/await

---

## âœ… 6. Mongoose Advanced Concepts

* Schema validation and constraints
* Default values, enums, min/max
* Schema methods (instance methods)
* Middleware / Hooks: `pre`, `post`
* Virtuals and populating references
* Indexes in Mongoose
* Relationship types: One-to-Many, Many-to-Many
* Transactions and session handling
* Lean queries (`.lean()`)
* Aggregation framework basics
* Discriminators (Schema inheritance)
* Mongoose plugins
* Soft delete strategy
* Performance tips (populate vs lean)

---

## âœ… 7. REST API Development

* What is REST? Best practices
* Structuring routes and controllers
* CRUD API for a resource
* Using Postman or Thunder Client for testing
* Request validation and error handling
* Pagination and filtering
* Nesting routes: `/users/:id/posts`
* API versioning: `/api/v1/`
* HTTP status codes
* Rate limiting & Throttling (e.g. express-rate-limit)

---

## âœ… 8. Authentication & Authorization

* Authentication vs Authorization
* User registration and login endpoints
* Password hashing with `bcryptjs`
* JSON Web Token (JWT) based auth
* Protecting routes with middleware
* Role-based access control
* Forgot/reset password flow
* Refresh tokens
* Token storage: headers vs cookies

---

## âœ… 9. Connecting to Frontend (React)

* Enable CORS and set headers
* Creating API endpoints consumable by React
* HTTP-only cookies (optional)
* Serving frontend from Express (optional)
* Environment variables: `.env` for both frontend and backend
* Proxy setup in React
* Handling auth errors in React

---

## âœ… 10. Deployment & Best Practices

* Folder structure for scalability (MVC pattern)
* Using Git and GitHub
* Environment configs: development vs production
* `.gitignore` essentials
* Logging and monitoring
* Deployment platforms: Render, Railway, Vercel
* MongoDB Atlas (Cloud DB)
* Graceful error handling
* Security best practices: `helmet`, `express-rate-limit`, `cors`, input sanitization

---
