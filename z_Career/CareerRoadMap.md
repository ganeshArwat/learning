**Focus Areas:**

1. **Frontend:**

   * React advanced concepts (RSC, SSR, SSG, Suspense, hooks, context, state management)
   * Next.js (for SSR/SSG experience and production readiness)
   * Testing (React Testing Library, Jest)

2. **Backend:**

   * Node.js + Express → REST APIs, authentication, JWT, middleware, error handling
   * MongoDB / PostgreSQL → complex queries, indexing, aggregation
   * Build **2–3 full-stack projects**: e-commerce, chat app, HR system clone

3. **Cloud & DevOps:**

   * Deploy apps on **AWS / GCP / Azure** (EC2, S3, Lambda)
   * CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions / Vercel / Netlify**
   * Dockerize full-stack apps

4. **DSA & HLD practice:**

   * Keep solving LeetCode / Codeforces problems (medium-hard)
   * Start designing small-scale system architectures (e.g., URL shortener, chat app)

---

## **3️⃣ Medium-Term Goals (6–18 months)**

**Goal:** Move to **senior full-stack + cloud engineer** or **software architect path**

**Focus Areas:**

1. **Backend Scalability & Architecture:**

   * Node.js clustering, caching (Redis), queue systems (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
   * Microservices architecture (Docker, Kubernetes basics)
   * API design patterns & versioning

2. **Cloud & DevOps Advanced:**

   * CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, monitoring/logging
   * Serverless architectures (AWS Lambda, API Gateway)
   * Cloud databases, scaling, cost optimization

3. **System Design:**

   * HLD/Large-scale systems (e.g., WhatsApp, Twitter-like clone)
   * Readable and scalable component architecture (React + Node + DB)
   * Learn about performance optimization and caching strategies

4. **Interview Preparation:**

   * Practice coding + system design interviews
   * Mock interviews for 10–13 LPA roles in Mumbai / remote

---

## **4️⃣ Long-Term Goals (18–36 months)**

**Goal:** Achieve **10–13 LPA+ role or software architect**

**Focus Areas:**

1. Lead small teams or projects → gain exposure to team coordination, requirement breakdown
2. Deep understanding of **frontend + backend + cloud + DevOps** → full-stack ownership
3. Master **React + Node + Cloud + Microservices** → marketable skill set
4. Target roles:

   * Senior Full-Stack Developer
   * Technical Lead / Software Architect
   * Cloud-Ready Full-Stack Engineer
