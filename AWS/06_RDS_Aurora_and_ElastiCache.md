# ‚òÅÔ∏è RDS, Aurora, & ElastiCache

---

## üß© Amazon RDS Overview

* **RDS** = Relational Database Service
* Managed AWS service for databases using **SQL** as a query language.
* Lets you create fully-managed cloud databases.

### ‚úÖ Supported Database Engines

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* MariaDB
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server
* IBM DB2
* **Amazon Aurora** (AWS Proprietary, MySQL & PostgreSQL compatible)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Use RDS Instead of DB on EC2

### üèóÔ∏è RDS is a Managed Service

* Automated provisioning & **OS patching**
* **Continuous backups** with **Point-in-Time Restore**
* **Monitoring dashboards**
* **Read Replicas** for read scalability
* **Multi-AZ setup** for disaster recovery
* **Maintenance windows** for version upgrades
* **Automatic scaling** (storage & compute)
* **EBS-backed storage**
* ‚ùå **No SSH access** to RDS instances (AWS manages the OS level)

---

        C --> C2
    end

    A -->|SQL Query| B
    A -->|SSH Access| C
```
---

## üìà RDS Storage Auto Scaling

* Automatically increases **storage size** as needed.
* Avoids manual scaling operations.

### ‚ö° Triggers Auto-Scaling When:

* Free storage < **10%** of allocated storage
* Condition lasts **‚â• 5 minutes**
* **6 hours** since last modification
* Within defined **Maximum Storage Threshold**

üß† **Use Case:** Applications with **unpredictable workloads**.

‚úÖ **Supported for all RDS engines.**

---

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant RDS as RDS Instance
    participant AWS as AWS Auto Scaling Service

    App->>RDS: Heavy DB Write Operations
    RDS->>AWS: Low Free Storage Alert (<10%)
    AWS->>RDS: Auto-scale storage (up to threshold)
    RDS->>App: Continues running with no downtime
```

---

## üß† RDS Read Replicas (Read Scalability)

* Up to **15 Read Replicas**
* Can be in:

  * Same AZ
  * Cross-AZ
  * Cross-Region
* **Asynchronous replication** (eventually consistent)
* Replicas can be **promoted** to standalone DBs
* Apps must **update connection strings** to use them

---

### üßæ Use Cases

* Run **reporting/analytics** workloads
* Reduce load on **production DB**
* Ideal for **read-heavy** operations (SELECT)
* Not for writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

---

### üí∏ Network Cost

* No cost for **intra-region** read replicas
* Data transfer costs apply **across regions**

---

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Primary DB Instance] -->|Async Replication| B[Read Replica 1]
    A -->|Async Replication| C[Read Replica 2]
    A -->|Async Replication| D[Read Replica 3]
    subgraph AZ1
        A
    end
    subgraph AZ2
        B
    end
    subgraph AZ3
        C
    end
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è RDS Multi-AZ (Disaster Recovery)

* **Synchronous replication** between primary and standby DB.
* **Automatic failover** using a single **DNS endpoint**.
* Improves **availability & resilience**.
* Used for **disaster recovery**, **not scaling**.
* Failover triggers:

  * AZ outage
  * Network failure
  * Storage/instance failure

---

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph AZ1
        A[Primary DB]
    end
    subgraph AZ2
        B[Standby DB]
    end
    A -- Sync Replication --> B
    C[App Layer] -->|Single Endpoint| A
    C -->|Auto Failover| B
```

---

### üîÑ Convert Single-AZ to Multi-AZ (Zero Downtime)

Steps performed by AWS internally:

1. Snapshot current DB.
2. Restore snapshot in another AZ.
3. Establish **sync replication** link.

‚úÖ No downtime
‚úÖ Fully automated

## üèóÔ∏è Aurora DB Cluster Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Aurora_Cluster"
        W[Writer_Endpoint_Primary]
        R1[Reader_Endpoint_1]
        R2[Reader_Endpoint_2]
        R3[Reader_Endpoint_3]
        V[(Cluster_Volume_6_Copies_3_AZs)]

        W --> V
        R1 --> V
        R2 --> V
        R3 --> V
    end

    App[Application_Servers]
    App -->|Write| W
    App -->|Read| R1
    App -->|Read| R2
    App -->|Read| R3
```

‚úÖ **Explanation:**

* Aurora separates **Compute (instances)** and **Storage (cluster volume)**.
* All nodes share the same cluster volume.
* **Endpoints** simplify access:

  * `Writer endpoint` ‚Üí single master
  * `Reader endpoint` ‚Üí load-balanced across replicas

# üß† Amazon ElastiCache ‚Äî Deep Dive Notes

---

## üöÄ 1. Overview

ElastiCache is AWS‚Äôs **fully managed in-memory data store** service supporting **Redis** and **Memcached**.

It helps you build **high-performance, low-latency, and scalable** applications by caching frequently accessed data in-memory rather than repeatedly querying databases or APIs.

### üîπ Key Highlights

* Like **RDS** (for managed relational DBs), **ElastiCache** provides **managed caching engines** (Redis & Memcached).
* Caches are **in-memory**, delivering **sub-millisecond latency**.
* Greatly **reduces load** on backend databases for read-heavy workloads.
* Helps make your applications **stateless** (ideal for horizontally scaled apps).
* AWS manages **OS patching, setup, scaling, monitoring, backups**, and **failover**.
* Requires **application code changes** to leverage caching logic.

---

## üèóÔ∏è 2. ElastiCache Solution Architecture ‚Äî DB Cache

Applications first check **ElastiCache** for data; if not found, they query **RDS** and store the result in cache for future requests.

* Reduces read load on RDS.
* Improves overall response time.
* Needs a **cache invalidation strategy** to ensure data freshness.

### üî∏ Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application] -->|Query| C[ElastiCache]
    C -->|Cache Hit| A
    C -->|Cache Miss| D[RDS Database]
    D -->|Return Data| A
    D -->|Store Result| C
```

---

## üë• 3. ElastiCache Solution Architecture ‚Äî User Session Store

Used for **session persistence** in stateless app environments.

* User logs into any instance of the app.
* Session data is stored in **ElastiCache**.
* On subsequent requests, even if the user hits a different app instance, their session is retrieved from cache.

### üî∏ Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    U[User] -->|Login| A1[App Instance 1]
    A1 -->|Store Session| C[ElastiCache]
    U -->|Next Request| A2[App Instance 2]
    A2 -->|Fetch Session| C
    A2 -->|User Already Logged In| U
```

## üß© 5. Caching Implementation Considerations

Before implementing caching, consider:

* **Safety:** Is it okay if cached data becomes slightly stale?
* **Effectiveness:** Is the data reused often enough to benefit from caching?
* **Pattern Suitability:**

  * ‚úÖ Good: Data changes slowly, few hot keys reused frequently.
  * üö´ Bad: Data changes constantly, wide key space.
* **Structure:** Is your data key‚Äìvalue friendly or aggregate query results?
* **Strategy:** Choose the right pattern (Lazy Loading, Write-Through, TTL, etc.).

üîó Read more: [AWS Caching Implementation Considerations](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/implementation-considerations/)

---

## üí§ 6. Lazy Loading / Cache-Aside Pattern

A **commonly used caching strategy** where data is loaded into cache **only when needed**.

### üîπ Flow

1. App checks cache for data.
2. If not found ‚Üí query DB.
3. Store DB result in cache.
4. Return response to user.

### ‚úÖ Pros

* Cache only stores what‚Äôs needed.
* Failure of cache nodes isn‚Äôt catastrophic (cache repopulates automatically).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons

* Cache miss penalty (extra round trips).
* Stale data possible if DB updates aren‚Äôt reflected in cache.

### üî∏ Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant Cache
    participant DB

    App->>Cache: Get(user_id)
    Cache-->>App: Cache Miss
    App->>DB: Query user data
    DB-->>App: Return record
    App->>Cache: Set(user_id, record)
    App-->>App: Use data
```

---

### üêç Python Pseudocode

```python
def get_user(user_id):
    # Check cache
    record = cache.get(user_id)

    if record is None:
        # Query database
        record = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
        # Store in cache
        cache.set(user_id, record)
    return record

# Usage
user = get_user(17)
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è 7. Write-Through Pattern

Data is **written to cache and database simultaneously**, ensuring consistency.

### ‚úÖ Pros

* Cache data is always up-to-date.
* Fast reads (cache is pre-populated).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons

* Each write = 2 calls (DB + cache).
* Cache churn (may store unused data).
* Often combined with Lazy Loading for efficiency.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Cache as ElastiCache
    participant DB as Database (RDS)

    App->>Cache: Write (user_id, values)
    App->>DB: Update (user_id, values)
    Cache-->>App: Acknowledged
    DB-->>App: Write successful
    Note over App,Cache: Cache & DB are updated together (Write-Through)
```

### üî∏ Python Pseudocode

```python
def save_user(user_id, values):
    # Save to DB
    record = db.query("UPDATE users SET ... WHERE id = ?", user_id, values)
    # Update cache
    cache.set(user_id, record)
    return record

# Usage
user = save_user(17, {"name": "Nate Dogg"})
```

---

## ‚è≥ 8. Cache Evictions & TTL (Time-To-Live)

### üßÆ Eviction Methods

1. **Manual Deletion** ‚Äì app explicitly removes cache entry.
2. **LRU (Least Recently Used)** ‚Äì cache evicts old data when memory fills.
3. **TTL Expiration** ‚Äì items auto-expire after a set time.

### üìä TTL Use Cases

* Leaderboards
* Comments
* Activity Streams
* Feed data

Set TTLs carefully:

* Too short ‚Üí frequent DB hits.
* Too long ‚Üí stale data risk.
* Too many evictions ‚Üí scale up or out.

---

## üí° 9. Best Practices & Final Thoughts

* Use **Lazy Loading / Cache-Aside** for read-heavy workloads.
* Combine **Write-Through** with Lazy Loading for balanced caching.
* Always configure **sensible TTLs**.
* Cache **only frequently accessed, slowly changing data** (e.g., user profiles, blog pages).
* Remember the golden rule:

  > ‚ÄúThere are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.‚Äù

---

## ‚ö° 10. Amazon MemoryDB for Redis

**MemoryDB** is a **Redis-compatible, durable in-memory database** ‚Äî ideal when you need the performance of cache + durability of a database.

### üîπ Features

* Fully **Redis-compatible**.
* **Multi-AZ**, with a durable **transaction log**.
* Handles **160M+ requests/sec**.
* Scales from **tens of GBs to hundreds of TBs**.
* Great for **real-time apps**, **gaming**, **media streaming**, and **session-heavy** systems.
