## 🧠 What You Should Learn in **HLD (High-Level Design)**

## 🧩 1. Fundamentals of System Design

**Learn:**

* What is System Design (difference between HLD & LLD)
* Client-Server model
* Computer Networks basics
  (TCP/IP, DNS, CDN, HTTP/HTTPS, Latency, Throughput)
* Scalability concepts: Vertical vs Horizontal scaling
* Availability, Reliability, Consistency, Fault Tolerance
* How to read and draw **system architecture diagrams**

**Goal:** Understand how data flows between clients, servers, caches, databases, and external systems.

## ⚖️ 2. Scalability and Data Distribution

**Learn:**

* **Load Balancers** (reverse proxy, L4 vs L7)
* **Consistent Hashing** (why it’s used in distributed systems)
* **Caching:**

  * Client-side, CDN, Reverse Proxy, Application cache (Redis, Memcached)
  * Cache invalidation, TTL, write-through vs write-back
* **Database Scaling:**

  * Sharding, replication, partitioning
* **CAP Theorem & PACELC**
* **Master–Slave replication**
* **Leader Election (Zookeeper basics)**

✅ *You’ve covered most of this — just make sure you can explain **why** you’d use each technique.*

## 🗄️ 3. Storage Systems and Databases

**Learn:**

* **SQL vs NoSQL** – When to use each
* **Database design trade-offs** (joins vs denormalization)
* **NoSQL Internals** (B-trees vs LSM trees)
* **Distributed databases:**

  * Multi-master replication
  * Conflict resolution
* **Object Storage:**

  * S3, HDFS concepts, chunking, replication
* **Search Systems:**

  * ElasticSearch, indexing, inverted index, relevance score

---

## 📨 4. Communication & Coordination Between Services

**Learn:**

* **Message Queues:** Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS

  * Producers/Consumers, partitions, offsets, consumer groups
* **Publish-Subscribe model**
* **Event-Driven Architecture**
* **Microservices communication:**

  * REST, gRPC, GraphQL, WebSockets
  * API Gateway
* **Service Discovery & Configuration management**

This is where “system design” meets “distributed systems.”

## ⚙️ 5. End-to-End System Design Practice (Case Studies)

Now you combine everything.

**Study and Design:**

* **Feed Systems:** Facebook/Instagram feed (ranking, caching)
* **Messaging Systems:** WhatsApp/Slack
* **Search Systems:** Google TypeAhead, ElasticSearch
* **Ride-sharing (Uber):** Nearest driver search, real-time updates
* **OTT (Netflix):** Video storage, streaming, recommendations
* **E-commerce:** Product catalog, checkout, inventory, payments
* **Rate limiter & Unique ID generator:** (Twitter Snowflake)
* **Large file storage:** (S3, HDFS)

✅ These are your *case studies* — gold for interviews.

Each teaches tradeoffs between **latency, consistency, cost, and complexity**.

## 🧩 6. (Optional but Powerful Add-ons)

Once you finish the above, add these to complete your HLD mastery:

### 📡 Monitoring & Observability

* Logging, metrics, tracing (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack)

### 🧰 System Design Tools

* C4 Model diagrams
* Sequence diagrams
* UML (basic use)

### ⚙️ Reliability & Scaling Patterns

* Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead, Retry, Rate Limiting
* Backpressure, Idempotency
* Blue-Green Deployment, Canary Release

## ✅ How to Learn HLD Effectively

1. **Understand each concept individually**
   → Watch/Read + Write small summaries.

2. **Apply it in a case study**
   → For example, after “Caching,” design “Facebook Feed.”

3. **Draw architecture diagrams**
   → Use tools like Excalidraw or Miro.

4. **Learn to explain tradeoffs**
   → *Why Redis over Memcached? Why Kafka over RabbitMQ? Why eventual consistency is OK here?*

5. **Practice mock design interviews**
   → System Design Blueprint (Grokking System Design), or YouTube channels like System Design Interview or Tech Dummies.
