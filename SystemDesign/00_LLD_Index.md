Perfect question again, Ganesh 👏

You’re learning **HLD (High-Level Design)** — which is about **architecture, scaling, and components**.

Now you’re asking about **LLD (Low-Level Design)** — which is the **engineering and design patterns behind the code** that make your system robust, maintainable, and extensible.

Let’s go step by step so you understand **what LLD is**, **why it matters**, and **what exactly you should learn** 👇

---

## 🧩 What is LLD?

**Low-Level Design (LLD)** focuses on *how to implement a system’s components in code* once the high-level architecture is ready.

If **HLD** answers “How the system works overall,”
then **LLD** answers “How each class, module, and function works internally.”

Think of it like this:

* HLD: “We’ll use a microservice architecture with Kafka and Redis.”
* LLD: “Inside the OrderService, what classes, interfaces, and design patterns will we use to handle order placement?”

---

## 🧠 Goals of Learning LLD

✅ Write **clean, extensible, testable** code
✅ Understand **object-oriented design (OOD)** deeply
✅ Be able to **translate HLD into actual code structure**
✅ Perform well in **LLD interviews** (Amazon, Swiggy, etc.)

## ⚙️ 1. Core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

You must be rock solid in OOP — this is the base of LLD.

**Learn deeply:**

* Classes, Objects, Abstraction
* Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
* Interfaces vs Abstract classes
* Composition over Inheritance
* SOLID Principles

**SOLID Principles:**

1. **S**ingle Responsibility
2. **O**pen/Closed
3. **L**iskov Substitution
4. **I**nterface Segregation
5. **D**ependency Inversion

**Practice:**
Refactor a small Node.js class or TypeScript service following SOLID.

---

## 🧱 2. Design Principles and Best Practices

These guide your code-level decisions.

**Learn:**

* DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
* KISS (Keep It Simple)
* YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
* Separation of Concerns
* High cohesion, low coupling
* Immutability & thread-safety
* Dependency Injection

---

## 🧩 3. Design Patterns (The Core of LLD)

This is the **most important LLD skill**.

### 🎨 **Creational Patterns**

How to create objects efficiently.

* Singleton
* Factory / Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype

### ⚙️ **Structural Patterns**

How to combine classes and objects.

* Adapter
* Decorator
* Composite
* Proxy
* Facade

### 🔁 **Behavioral Patterns**

How classes communicate and handle responsibilities.

* Observer
* Strategy
* Command
* State
* Chain of Responsibility
* Template Method

✅ *You don’t need to memorize all — learn 2–3 examples per category with code.*

---

## 🧰 4. UML and Class Diagram Design

You should be able to express your LLD ideas visually.

**Learn:**

* Class diagrams (classes, relationships, associations)
* Sequence diagrams (flow of calls between classes)
* Activity diagrams (flow of logic)

**Tools:** draw.io, Excalidraw, Lucidchart

---

## 🧮 5. Common LLD Case Studies

Practice small **end-to-end OOD problems**.
These appear in interviews and help bridge theory to practice.

### 🔹 Beginner

* Design a Parking Lot System
* Design a Vending Machine
* Design a Library Management System
* Design a Movie Ticket Booking System
* Design a StackOverflow or Notification System

### 🔹 Intermediate

* Design Elevator System
* Design Splitwise
* Design Snake & Ladder / Chess Game
* Design Rate Limiter
* Design Logging Framework

### 🔹 Advanced

* Design Uber / Swiggy at class-level
* Design Netflix Player module
* Design Payment Gateway module
* Design a Distributed Cache client (like Redis client SDK)

✅ *These help you connect OOP + Patterns + Real-World problem solving.*

---

## 🧩 6. LLD in Modern Backend (Node.js / TypeScript Context)

Since you’re moving toward **Node Microservices**, you should also understand LLD from a **real-world backend** lens:

**Learn:**

* Service Layer architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
* DTOs, Models, Interfaces (TypeScript)
* Dependency Injection frameworks (like InversifyJS)
* Using Design Patterns in backend (Strategy for payments, Observer for notifications, Factory for DB connections)
* Error handling, Logging, Retry mechanisms
* Testable modular code (Jest, mocks)

---

## 🧠 7. Extra (but valuable) LLD Topics

* **Concurrency control** (locks, threads, async handling)
* **Transaction management**
* **API design best practices (REST + GraphQL)**
* **Versioning and backward compatibility**
* **Config management**
* **Clean code principles (Robert C. Martin)**

## 🔁 HLD vs LLD in a nutshell

| Concept | HLD                              | LLD                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Scope   | Whole system                     | Individual components                      |
| Focus   | Architecture, Scaling, Data flow | Classes, Methods, Logic                    |
| Level   | Abstract                         | Detailed                                   |
| Output  | Architecture Diagram             | Class Diagram + Code Skeleton              |
| Example | Design Uber                      | Design Uber’s Ride Matching Engine classes |
