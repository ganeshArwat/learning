# üì® Messaging Queues

---

### üîπ Definition

* An **asynchronous communication mechanism**.
* Messages (data or events) are placed onto a queue by **producers** and later processed by **consumers**.

---

### üîπ Key Idea

* Follows **Publisher-Subscriber (Pub-Sub / Producer-Consumer) pattern**.
* Decouples **sending** from **receiving**, allowing independent scaling.

---

### üîπ Components

1. **Producers (Publishers / Senders)**

   * Push messages into the queue.

2. **Consumers (Subscribers / Receivers)**

   * Consume messages from the queue.
   * Process messages and acknowledge completion.

3. **Queue**

   * Holds messages in **FIFO order** (first-in, first-out).

---

‚úÖ **Benefits:**

* Decouples services ‚Üí improves scalability
* Enables asynchronous processing ‚Üí reduces blocking
* Provides **reliability and fault tolerance** via message persistence

### Diff Between PubSub, Observer, Event Handler patterns

#### **1. Observer Pattern**

- **Intent:** Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the **subject**) changes state, all its dependents (**observers**) are notified automatically.
- **Structure:**

  - `Subject` maintains a list of `Observers`.
  - Observers register themselves with the subject.
  - When the subject‚Äôs state changes, it **pushes updates** to all observers.

- **Communication:** **Direct**; the subject knows its observers.
- **Coupling:** **Tightly coupled** (subject holds references to observers).
- **Use-case Examples:**

  - GUI frameworks: Button click updates multiple UI components.
  - Data binding in MVC/MVVM frameworks (React hooks, Vue watchers).

- **Analogy:** A teacher announces to the students in class whenever there‚Äôs an update.

---

#### **2. PubSub (Publisher-Subscriber) Pattern**

- **Intent:** Decouple the sender of messages (**publisher**) from the receivers (**subscribers**) via a **message broker**.
- **Structure:**

  - Publishers **publish messages** to a **channel/topic**.
  - Subscribers **subscribe to a channel/topic** to receive messages.
  - Publishers and subscribers **do not know about each other**.

- **Communication:** **Indirect** via a broker or event bus.
- **Coupling:** **Loosely coupled**; publisher doesn‚Äôt know who is listening.
- **Use-case Examples:**

  - Event-driven systems, microservices, message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
  - Chat applications where multiple clients receive messages.

- **Analogy:** A radio station broadcasts to listeners; the station doesn‚Äôt know who is listening.

---

#### **3. Event Handler (Callback) Pattern**

- **Intent:** Execute a **callback function** in response to an event.
- **Structure:**

  - Register functions (handlers) for specific events.
  - When the event occurs, all registered functions are invoked.

- **Communication:** **Direct**; the event emitter calls registered handlers.
- **Coupling:** Varies; usually looser than Observer but tighter than PubSub.
- **Use-case Examples:**

  - DOM events in JavaScript (`button.onclick = handleClick`).
  - Node.js `EventEmitter`.

- **Analogy:** Pressing a button triggers a specific action (handler).

| **Number of Subscribers** | Usually known             | Many, dynamic                        | Many, dynamic                  |
| **Who knows whom**        | Subject knows observers   | Neither knows each other             | Emitter knows handlers         |
| **Push vs Pull**          | Push updates              | Push events                          | Push events (callback invoked) |
| **Use-cases**             | GUI updates, data binding | Event-driven apps, messaging systems | DOM events, Node.js events     |

---

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Observer**: Tight coupling, direct, designed for objects within the same process.
- **PubSub**: Loose coupling, indirect, designed for distributed systems or decoupled modules.
- **Event Handler**: Lightweight, usually direct, mainly for handling events in a single process (like UI events).

Here‚Äôs your **Pub-Sub / Messaging Queue Benefits and Considerations** section formatted into a clean study guide note:

---

# üì¨ Benefits & Considerations of Pub-Sub / Messaging Queues

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Pub-Sub

1. **Decoupling**

   * Services can scale independently.
   * Improves fault tolerance: failure of one service does not block others.

2. **Load Leveling (Shock Absorber)**

   * Smooths spikes in traffic by queuing messages.

3. **Buffering & Reliability**

   * Messages persist in the queue until successfully processed.
   * Ensures reliable communication between systems.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

1. **Communication between microservices**

   * Decouples services and allows async interactions.

2. **Async Processing / Task Scheduling**

   * Offloads long-running tasks to background workers.

3. **Event-Driven Pipelines / Event Tracking**

   * Captures and processes events (e.g., user actions, notifications).

4. **Data-Driven Pipelines**

   * Feeds data to multiple downstream systems asynchronously.

5. **Logging**

   * Collect logs reliably from multiple services for processing/analytics.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons / Limitations

1. Cannot perform synchronous tasks.

2. **Higher latency** compared to direct API calls

   * Latency = time from adding task to queue ‚Üí task processed by consumer.
   * Usually small (<2ms if queue is empty).

3. **Additional infrastructure required**

   * Messaging queues often run on clusters of servers.

4. **Higher network overhead**

   * Extra communication between producers, queue, and consumers.

---

## üí° Need to Justify

* Do **not use message queues unnecessarily**.
* They are **complex to setup, use, and maintain**.
* Must have a clear **justification** for using them.

---

## üìå Most Common Message Queues

1. **Apache Kafka**

   * Most popular, scalable, feature-rich.
   * Can deploy self-managed or use **managed services** like Confluent.

2. **RabbitMQ**

   * Common, simpler, less powerful than Kafka.

3. **Amazon SQS**

   * Fully managed service, no setup required.
   * Internally uses Kafka and other technologies.

---

# üü¢ Apache Kafka

---

### üîπ Overview

* **Open Source:** Originally built at LinkedIn, now part of Apache.
* **High Throughput:** Can handle **up to 10M messages/sec** (trillions/day).
* **Ultra Low Latency:** Typically **<2ms** from insertion to consumption if queue is empty.
* **Horizontal Scalability:**

  * Manages partitions automatically across brokers.
  * Supports **1000s of brokers**, **100,000s of partitions**, **petabytes of data**.
* **Fault Tolerant:**

  * Replicates messages across multiple servers.
  * Stores messages on disk.
* **High Availability:** Clusters can be deployed across multiple availability zones.
* **Persistent:**

  * Messages are saved to disk.
  * Multiple consumer groups can consume the same message.
* **Message Ordering:** Strict ordering **within each partition**.
* **Battle-tested:** Used by major companies and thousands of others.

---

### üîπ Message (Record / Event / Task)

* Records that **‚Äúsomething happened‚Äù** in the system or business.

**Structure:**

```json
{
  "topic": "...",      // queue/topic for this message
  "value": "...",      // payload (JSON / string / binary)
  "timestamp": "...",  // creation or append time (auto-filled)
  "key": "...",        // optional, for partitioning
  "headers": "..."     // optional, routing/processing info
}
```

**Kafka Notes:**

* Append-only log
* Strict FIFO reads **within a partition**
* Cannot update, delete, or search messages
* Messages auto-delete after ~7 days
* Message size should be **a few KBs at most**

---
## üîπ Producers & Consumers

### Producers

* Applications that **publish/write events** to Kafka.
* Fully decoupled from consumers ‚Äî they **never wait** for consumers to process messages.

### Consumers

* Applications that **subscribe/read and process events** from Kafka.
* Fully decoupled from producers.

---

# üîπ Consumer Groups (Scalability)

**Challenges:**

1. A single consumer may not handle all messages (e.g., 10M/sec).
2. Multiple types of consumers may need the same messages.

**Solution:**

* Use **multiple consumers per task category**.
* Consumers must provide a **group.id** when joining.
* Kafka assigns a **coordinator** for each consumer group.

  * Consumers send **heartbeats** to the coordinator to remain alive.
* Messages are **distributed among consumers** in a group, allowing **parallel processing**.

---

# üîπ Topics

* Messages are categorized into **topics**.
* Each message belongs to **exactly one topic**.
* Think of a topic as a **folder**, and messages as **files** (Kafka literally stores them like this).

**Reference:** [Kafka ProducerRecord JavaDoc](https://kafka.apache.org/39/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/ProducerRecord.html)

**Rules:**

* Producers **must specify the topic** when sending a message.
* Topics can have:

  * Zero, one, or many **producers** writing events.
  * Zero, one, or many **consumers** subscribing to events.

---

# **Kafka: Partitions (Message Ordering & Scalability)**

### üîπ **Challenge**

1. A single server is **not enough** to store all messages in a topic.

   * Topics like `"1-1 chat messages"` or `"tweets"` can contain **billions of events**.
   * Hence, topics must be **partitioned** to distribute storage across multiple brokers (servers).

2. Sometimes, we need **strict message ordering** (e.g., chat messages, GPS coordinates).

   * Ensuring strict ordering across servers requires **distributed locks**, which are **slow and complex**.

---

### üîπ **Solution**

* A **topic** is divided into multiple **partitions**.
* Each **partition** is stored entirely on a **single Kafka broker**.

  * It can be **replicated** to other brokers for **fault tolerance**.
* **Publishers and consumers** can read/write across multiple partitions, giving **high throughput**.
* Kafka guarantees **ordering only within a single partition** (not across partitions).

---

### üîπ **Partition Assignment (Which partition gets the message?)**

* If the event has a **key**, Kafka uses:

  ```
  partition = hash(key) % number_of_partitions
  ```
* If the event has **no key**, Kafka uses **round-robin assignment** to partitions.
* All messages with the **same key** always go to the **same partition**, preserving ordering.

**Example message:**

```json
{
  "key": "conversation_id",
  "topic": "messages",
  "value": {
    "message": "Hi",
    "prev_message_id": "...",
    "attachment_url": "...",
    "geolocation": "..."
  },
  "timestamp": "...",
  "headers": { }
}
```

---

### üîπ **Consumer‚ÄìPartition Mapping & Consumer Offsets**

* Each **partition** in a topic is consumed by **exactly one consumer** in a **consumer group**.
* Kafka maintains a **consumer offset** (integer) for every *(partition, consumer)* pair ‚Üí tells the consumer which message to read next.
* Offsets are stored in a special topic: `__consumer_offsets`.

**Rules:**

* Same partition ‚Üí only one consumer per group.
* Same consumer ‚Üí can consume from multiple partitions.
* Multiple groups can consume from the same partition independently.

---

### üîπ **Best Practices**

* Ensure:

  ```
  #partitions ‚â• #consumers
  ```

  * Extra consumers = idle.
  * A consumer can handle multiple partitions, but a partition can‚Äôt go to multiple consumers.

* Create **more partitions than needed** at the start (scales better later).

  * Changing partition count later is **possible but risky**:

    * May cause **downtime**.
    * May **break delivery guarantees** (offsets change).

---

### üîπ **Rebalancing**

* When a consumer **joins or leaves** a group, Kafka **reassigns partitions** among remaining consumers.
* A **group coordinator** broker manages this, maintaining **heartbeats** to track active consumers.

---

### üîπ **Partition Facts**

* Number of partitions = configured **per topic**.
* A single **Kafka broker** can store **multiple partitions**.
* Each partition lives **fully inside one broker**, but is **replicated** to others.
* Kafka uses **partition-based sharding** with **master-slave replication** for fault tolerance.

---

Here‚Äôs your **Kafka Delivery Guarantees** section ‚Äî fully formatted into a clear, concise **study guide style**, matching your previous sections (no tables, just structured markdown):

---

# **Kafka Delivery Guarantees**

Kafka provides three types of message delivery guarantees:

### üîπ **1. At Most Once**

* Messages **may be lost**, but **never redelivered**.
* Delivery count: **0 or 1**, never more than once.
* No duplicates, but possible data loss.

### üîπ **2. At Least Once**

* Messages are **never lost**, but **may be redelivered**.
* Delivery count: **1 or more times** (duplicates possible).
* Safe but can cause duplicate processing.

### üîπ **3. Exactly Once**

* Each message is **delivered once and only once**.
* No data loss, no duplication.
* This is the **ideal** guarantee most systems want.

---

## **Producer Delivery Guarantees**

When a **producer or Kafka broker** crashes, message delivery reliability depends on how Kafka handles failures.

### üí° **Possible Failure Scenarios**

1. **Producer fails** before sending message ‚Üí message never reaches Kafka.
2. **Network fails** ‚Üí Kafka never receives the request.
3. **Kafka broker receives message but crashes before saving** ‚Üí message lost.
4. **Kafka saves message but crashes before acknowledging** ‚Üí uncertain delivery.
5. **Kafka saves & acknowledges, but ack never reaches producer** ‚Üí producer retries.

### üî∏ **How Kafka Handles It**

* Kafka **commits messages to disk** for durability.
* **Producer retries** automatically on failure.
* Kafka producers can use **idempotent mode**:

  * Retries won‚Äôt create duplicates ‚Äî same message written only once.
  * Can be disabled for lower latency (but increases duplicate risk).

‚úÖ **Result:**

* Thanks to retries + idempotency ‚Üí **Producers achieve ‚Äúexactly once‚Äù delivery** (to Kafka).

---

## **Consumer Delivery Guarantees**

Consumers must **commit offsets** to Kafka to track progress.
Depending on when this happens, delivery semantics change.

### **a. Read ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Process**

‚û°Ô∏è **At Most Once Delivery**

* Message might be lost if consumer crashes before processing.
* Consumer commits offset early, so replacement consumer skips that message.

### **b. Read ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Commit**

‚û°Ô∏è **At Least Once Delivery**

* Safe against data loss, but duplicates possible.
* If crash happens before committing, new consumer will reprocess same message.

---

## **Exactly Once Delivery (End-to-End)**

To achieve **exactly once** semantics end-to-end:

* Use **Kafka Transactions** (supported in Kafka Streams).
* Or, store the **consumer offset and output data together atomically** (custom implementation).
* This ensures each message is processed and recorded exactly once.

---

## **Kafka‚Äôs Default Behavior**

* By default, Kafka provides **At-Least-Once** delivery:

  * Producers retry on failure.
  * Consumers process before committing offset.

**Implications:**

* Safe from data loss.
* But **duplicate messages** can occur.

---

## **Important Note**

* Kafka guarantees depend on **how producers and consumers are configured**.
* A consumer can even **manually reset or skip offsets** for reprocessing.
* Therefore, the **true delivery guarantee** is ultimately determined by your **application logic**.

---

# **Kafka Brokers (Sharding & Replication)**

### üîπ **What is a Broker?**

* A **Broker** in Kafka is simply a **server** running the Kafka software.
* Each broker:

  * Stores messages in **logs**.
  * Manages partitions of topics assigned to it.
  * Handles both **producer writes** and **consumer reads**.

---

## **1. Sharding**

* Kafka **shards** data by:

  * **Topic** ‚Üí Logical grouping of messages.
  * **Partition** ‚Üí Subset of a topic, distributed across brokers.
* Each broker holds **one or more partitions** of different topics.

---

## **2. Replication**

* Each partition is **replicated across multiple brokers** to ensure **fault tolerance**.
* Replication follows a **master-slave (leader-follower)** model:

  * **Leader (master)** handles all reads and writes for that partition.
  * **Followers (slaves)** replicate data from the leader.

### **Write & Read Behavior**

* **Writes:** Go to the **leader** and (optionally) to a **majority of replicas**.
* **Reads:** Served from any **in-sync replica (ISR)**, typically the leader.
* A message is considered **‚Äúcommitted‚Äù** only when:

  * It‚Äôs successfully written to **all replicas** (leader + followers).

### **Producer & Consumer Interaction**

* **Producer options:**

  * Can choose to wait for **full replication (strong consistency)** before acknowledging success.
  * Or return **quick acknowledgment** after writing only to the leader (faster but less consistent).
* **Consumer behavior:**

  * Consumers only read **committed messages** ‚Äî ensuring they see consistent data.

---

## **3. Replication Details**

* **Replication factor:** Configurable per topic (commonly 3 for production).
* **Master distribution:** Kafka evenly distributes leaders across brokers for load balancing.
* **Consistency preference:** Kafka prioritizes **consistency over availability** (especially during partitions).

---

## **4. Message Retention Policy**

* Kafka retains messages for a **default of 7 days**.
* During this retention window:

  * Messages can be consumed **by any number of consumers**, but only **once per consumer group**.
* After the retention period:

  * Kafka **automatically deletes** the messages, regardless of whether they were consumed.

### **Retention Configuration**

* Can be configured by:

  * **Time-based retention** (e.g., 7 days, 24 hours)
  * **Size-based retention** (e.g., 1GB per partition)

---

‚úÖ **Summary**

* Kafka brokers form the backbone of Kafka clusters.
* They manage **sharding (partitions)** and **replication (redundancy)**.
* Kafka ensures **fault tolerance**, **high throughput**, and **consistent reads** through leader-based replication and configurable retention.

# üß© Kafka Core Relationships Explained

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Topic ‚Äî The Logical Channel**

Think of a **topic** as a **category** or **stream name**.

üì¶ Example:
A topic named `"user-signups"` stores all signup events.

* It‚Äôs **just a logical name** ‚Äî like a folder name.
* Inside it, Kafka physically stores data in **partitions**.

```
Topic: user-signups
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Partition 0
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Partition 1
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Partition 2
```

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Partition ‚Äî The Unit of Parallelism**

Each **topic** is divided into **partitions**.

* A **partition** is an **ordered, immutable log** of messages.
* Every message inside a partition gets a **unique offset** (0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶).
* Kafka **appends** new messages to the **end** of a partition.
* Each partition is stored **on one broker (leader)** and replicated to others (followers).

### üìò Why partitions matter:

* **Scalability:** More partitions = more parallel reads/writes.
* **Ordering:** Kafka guarantees **message order only within a partition**, not across partitions.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Broker ‚Äî The Physical Server**

A **broker** is simply a Kafka **server**.

Each broker:

* Stores **one or more partitions**.
* Acts as the **leader** for some partitions and **follower** for others.
* Communicates with other brokers to **replicate data** and ensure fault tolerance.

### Example:

| Broker   | Partitions Hosted | Role                           |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Broker 1 | P0, P3            | Leader for P0, Follower for P3 |
| Broker 2 | P1, P0(replica)   | Leader for P1, Follower for P0 |
| Broker 3 | P2, P1(replica)   | Leader for P2, Follower for P1 |

üß† So, a **topic is distributed** across multiple brokers using **partitions**.

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Consumer & Consumer Groups**

### üéØ **Consumer**

A **consumer** reads messages from a **topic‚Äôs partitions**.

* It remembers where it left off using **offsets**.
* It only reads **committed messages** (replicated and acknowledged).

---

### üë• **Consumer Group**

A **consumer group** is a **set of consumers working together** to read from a topic **in parallel**.

Kafka assigns **each partition to exactly one consumer** in the group.

| Topic: user-signups | Partitions | Assigned Consumer |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Partition 0         | Consumer A |                   |
| Partition 1         | Consumer B |                   |
| Partition 2         | Consumer C |                   |

üí° Rules:

1. **Each partition ‚Üí only one consumer** in a consumer group.
2. But **multiple consumer groups** can consume the same topic independently.

So:

* Consumer Group 1 (for analytics)
* Consumer Group 2 (for monitoring)
  Both can read the same topic ‚Äî Kafka will maintain separate offsets.

| **Partition**      | Ordered log of messages; order guaranteed *within* partition                          |
| **Broker**         | Kafka server storing partitions (leaders & replicas)                                  |

---

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Example Summary Scenario**

üß© Topic: `"payments"`
üß© Partitions: 3
üß© Brokers: 3
üß© Replication factor: 3
üß© Consumer Group: `"payment-processor"` with 3 consumers

* Each partition lives on a different broker (with replicas on others).
* Each consumer in the group gets **one partition**.
* All consumers together read the entire topic **in parallel**.
* If a consumer crashes, Kafka **reassigns** its partition to another consumer automatically.

---

‚úÖ **TL;DR:**

* **Topic:** logical stream
* **Partition:** subset of topic (enables scaling)
* **Broker:** server storing partitions
* **Consumer Group:** set of consumers dividing the partitions
* **Rule:** one partition ‚Üí one consumer (per group)
* **Result:** Kafka scales horizontally, keeps order per partition, and allows multiple independent consumer groups.

# üß≠ Kafka Cluster Coordination: ZooKeeper vs KRaft

---

## üß± 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why Kafka Needed ZooKeeper

Kafka itself is a **distributed system** ‚Äî meaning it runs across many brokers (servers).
To work properly, it needs a **single source of truth** for cluster coordination.

Kafka brokers need to know:

* Which brokers are alive?
* Which broker is the **leader** for each partition?
* Where is each **replica** stored?
* What‚Äôs the **offset** of each consumer group?
* What **topics** exist and how many **partitions** they have?

Kafka didn‚Äôt originally include a built-in coordination system ‚Äî so it used **ZooKeeper**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ What ZooKeeper Does (in Kafka)

ZooKeeper maintains **metadata** and does **cluster coordination** for Kafka.

| Responsibility                     | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| üß† **Broker registry**             | Keeps track of which brokers are alive (via heartbeats).                                         |
| üóÇÔ∏è **Topic & partition metadata** | Stores info about which topics exist, how many partitions each has.                              |
| üß≠ **Partition leadership**        | Keeps info about which broker is the **leader** and which are **followers** for every partition. |
| üë• **Consumer group coordination** | Maps which consumer owns which partition (consumer rebalancing).                                 |
| üìç **Offsets tracking**            | Keeps last committed offset for each (consumer group, topic, partition).                         |
| üîê **Access control & quotas**     | Stores ACLs, quotas, configurations, etc.                                                        |

üß© ZooKeeper is basically a **configuration & coordination database** for Kafka.

---

## ‚ö° 3Ô∏è‚É£ How Kafka & ZooKeeper Communicate

### Simplified flow:

1. Kafka broker starts ‚Üí registers itself in ZooKeeper.
2. ZooKeeper tracks broker health using **heartbeats**.
3. When a broker dies, ZooKeeper tells other brokers to **elect a new leader** for its partitions.
4. When new topics or partitions are created, ZooKeeper stores this configuration.
5. Kafka Controller (a special broker) gets metadata from ZooKeeper and manages replication & rebalancing.

So ZooKeeper was **central to everything**, but this also led to **scalability issues**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4Ô∏è‚É£ Limitations of ZooKeeper

| Problem                         | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| üß© **Two systems = complexity** | Kafka had to run **and manage ZooKeeper** separately. Harder to maintain and secure. |
| üê¢ **Performance bottleneck**   | ZooKeeper couldn‚Äôt handle frequent writes (like offset commits) at high scale.       |
| üß± **Scalability limit**        | Kafka clusters with >200,000 partitions caused ZooKeeper lag and instability.        |
| üß† **Split-brain risks**        | In network failures, ZooKeeper and Kafka controller could get out of sync.           |
| üß∞ **Manual recovery**          | Recovering from ZooKeeper corruption was painful and required manual fixes.          |

---

## üöÄ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Enter KRaft (Kafka Raft Metadata Mode)

Starting from **Kafka 2.8 (2021)**, Kafka introduced **KRaft mode** ‚Äî
Kafka‚Äôs own internal **metadata quorum** based on the **Raft consensus algorithm**.

üß† **KRaft = Kafka + Raft**

It **removes the need for ZooKeeper entirely** and lets Kafka manage itself.

---

## üß© 6Ô∏è‚É£ What KRaft Does

Everything ZooKeeper did ‚Äî but *inside Kafka itself* using Raft.

| Function             | ZooKeeper (old)            | KRaft (new)                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Metadata store       | Separate ZooKeeper cluster | Stored inside Kafka itself  |
| Consensus algorithm  | ZooKeeper‚Äôs Zab protocol   | Raft consensus protocol     |
| Cluster coordination | External process           | Internal Kafka quorum       |
| Controller           | One broker elected via ZK  | One broker elected via Raft |
| Scalability          | ~200K partitions           | Millions of partitions      |
| Recovery             | Manual, fragile            | Automated, self-healing     |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7Ô∏è‚É£ Raft Consensus in KRaft (simplified)

Raft ensures **consistency** and **high availability** of metadata.

1. Kafka cluster has **Controller Quorum Nodes** (a few brokers dedicated to metadata).
2. One becomes the **Controller Leader**.
3. All metadata changes (like new topic, partition reassignment, etc.) go through the leader.
4. The leader replicates metadata logs to the follower nodes.
5. If leader fails, followers elect a **new leader** automatically (via Raft election).

### üîÑ ZooKeeper vs KRaft ‚Äî Additional Reference

* For more details on the **Raft Consensus Algorithm**, see the official Raft website:
  [https://raft.github.io](https://raft.github.io)

---

# ü¶ì ZooKeeper

## Overview

**ZooKeeper** is a **distributed coordination service** used by distributed applications to handle:

* Synchronization
* Configuration management
* Naming and group services

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**
> ZooKeeper is **NOT a database**.
> It is meant for **storing backend configuration and coordination data**, **not** business or user-generated data.

ZooKeeper ensures **immediate consistency** across distributed backends.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è ZooKeeper Filesystem

ZooKeeper exposes a **special filesystem-like structure** accessible over the network through APIs.

### üß± Core Concepts

#### üîπ ZNodes

* Every file or directory in ZooKeeper is called a **ZNode**.
* ZNodes can be of two types:

  1. **Persistent ZNodes** ‚Äì regular files or directories that remain even after the client disconnects.
  2. **Ephemeral ZNodes** ‚Äì temporary files/directories **owned by a server**.

     * Exist only as long as the session with the owning server is alive.
     * If the server disconnects or fails, ZooKeeper automatically deletes its ephemeral nodes.
     * Each ephemeral ZNode has exactly **one owner**.
     * Only the owner can **modify** it; others can **read** or **watch** it.

---

### üì¶ What Can Be Stored

You can store **small configuration files** (typically a few KBs, up to a few MBs).
‚úÖ Suitable for:

* Backend configuration data
* Metadata (master-slave configs, secrets, service locations)

üö´ Not suitable for:

* User data
* Business logic data

---

### üóÉÔ∏è Example ZooKeeper Structure

```
/
|-- db_secret_key.txt
|-- openai_api_key.txt
|-- aws_iam_key.txt
|-- master_slave_config/
|   |-- master_ip
|   |-- slaves/
|       |-- a3b2c_ip.txt
|       |-- 2ccfd_ip.txt
|       |-- 13aa4_ip.txt
|       |-- dd12f_ip.txt
```

---

## üß† Example Scenario: Watching for Key Changes

### Scenario:

An application server needs to use an **OpenAI API key** stored in ZooKeeper.

When the server starts:

* It retrieves the key from ZooKeeper.
* It **sets a ‚Äúwatch‚Äù** on the key so that if the key changes, ZooKeeper pushes the updated value automatically.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Code Flow (Conceptual)

```java
String key = zookeeperClient.setWatch("/openai_api_key.txt", handleKeyChange);
```

#### On Each User Request

```java
void handleUserRequest() {
    openAiClient.call(OpenAiApiKey, "<System Prompt>");
}
```

> ‚ùå The app should **NOT fetch the key every time** from ZooKeeper.
> ‚úÖ Instead, it should keep a **local copy** and **update it automatically** when ZooKeeper notifies of a change.

---

### üß© How Watching Works

Clients (servers) can **set a watch** on a ZNode.

If the node‚Äôs data changes:

* ZooKeeper **pushes the new value** to the client via the persistent session.

#### Example Pseudocode:

```java
string open_ai_api_key = "";

void fetch_openai_key() {
    zookeeperClient.setWatch("/openai_api_key", onKeyUpdate);
}

void onKeyUpdate(value) {
    open_ai_api_key = value;
}

onServerStart => {
    zookeeperClient.initialize();
    fetch_openai_key();

    zookeeperClient.onDisconnect(() => {
        open_ai_api_key = ""; // prevent using stale data
    });
}
```

---

‚úÖ **Summary**

* ZooKeeper acts as a **coordination layer**, not a database.
* Data is stored as **ZNodes** (persistent or ephemeral).
* Servers can **watch nodes** for real-time configuration updates.
* Ephemeral nodes are automatically deleted when their owning server fails.

---

Here‚Äôs a **clean, structured version** of your Zookeeper replication & master-slave configuration notes, keeping all technical details and links intact:

---

# üß≠ Zookeeper ‚Äî Replication & Master-Slave Management

## üîπ Replication

* Zookeeper itself is **replicated** using a **Master-Slave (Quorum)** configuration.
* Ensures **high availability** and fault tolerance.
* Writes are only allowed to the **leader/master**, while reads can be served by followers.

---

## üîπ Sharding

* **Zookeeper is NOT sharded!**
* It‚Äôs **not a database** ‚Äî only designed for **small configuration data** (few MBs).
* Use nested ZNodes if you want logical separation (e.g., per shard).

---

## üîπ Managing Master-Slave Configuration via Zookeeper

Zookeeper can maintain your **custom Master-Slave system**, e.g., for a database shard.

### Steps for Master Election

1. Maintain a **master-slave config** in Zookeeper.
2. Master must own a **`master_ip` ephemeral ZNode**.
3. All slaves set a **watch** on the `master_ip` node.
4. If the master crashes:

   * Heartbeats stop ‚Üí Zookeeper deletes the **ephemeral node**.
   * Zookeeper notifies all slaves.
5. All slaves attempt to **create the `master_ip` node** with their own IP.
6. The **first slave** to succeed becomes the new master.

   * Zookeeper ensures only **one owner** can modify ephemeral nodes.
7. Zookeeper notifies all slaves of the new master.

---

### Handling Master Recovery

* When the old master comes back online, it **joins as a slave**.
* **Data consistency:**

  * Slaves might have stale data individually.
  * Majority of replicas are up-to-date ‚Üí system consistency maintained.
* **Challenge:** New master cannot immediately accept writes if it may be stale.

  * Developer must implement a **catch-up mechanism**.

üîó **Sample approach:** [Kafka Leader Recovery](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design:~:text=But%20followers%20themselves,these%20for%20now)
üîó **Kafka approach:** [Kafka Leader Election](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design:~:text=Kafka%20takes%20a,losing%20committed%20messages)

---

### Failure Scenarios

1. **Only Master crashes**

   * Slaves compete for election ‚Üí one succeeds ‚Üí new master elected. ‚úÖ

2. **Zookeeper master crashes**

   * Does **not affect your application data**.
   * Zookeeper only stores **internal config**, not user data.
   * Cannot perform **writes/changes** until Zookeeper leader is re-elected.
   * Reads still work.

3. **Both Master & Zookeeper leader crash simultaneously**

   * Master re-election must **wait for Zookeeper leader recovery**.
   * Slightly higher latency for master election. ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

### Managing Multiple Shards with Replication

* Simply **nest shard data** in Zookeeper:

```
/
|--- shard_1/
|    |--- master_ip.txt
|    |--- slaves/
|        |--- ...
|--- shard_2/
|    |--- master_ip.txt
|    |--- slaves/
|        |--- ...
```

* Each shard can have **its own master-slave election** independently.
* Zookeeper handles ephemeral nodes and notifications for all shards.
