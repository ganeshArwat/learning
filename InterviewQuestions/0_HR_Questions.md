## ✅ Self-Introduction & Background Questions

### 1. Tell me about yourself.
#### A. MERN Stack Role – Focused Answer
`"Hi, I’m Ganesh Arwat. I’ve completed my B.Sc. in IT, where I secured first rank in my college. During my final year, my project was recognized among the Top 100 Innovative Projects at the CIIA Exhibition, which was a great motivation early in my career. After graduation, I joined a startup that developed its own SaaS product, and over the next 2 years, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development. One of my key contributions there was building the entire export module for their SaaS platform, which enhanced reporting and client-side usability. After two years, I chose to resign and focus on upskilling. I enrolled in Scaler Academy, and within 6 months, I earned the Top 1% Learner badge. I’m still pursuing the course, working on real-world projects, and completing certifications in areas like DSA, system design, and modern web technologies. Currently, I’m looking for a PHP Laravel Developer role where I can apply my backend expertise, contribute to product development, and continue growing in a collaborative environment`

### 2. Walk me through your resume.

`Sure! My name is Ganesh Arwat, and I completed my B.Sc. in Information Technology from Mumbai University in 2022 with a 9.45 CGPA, securing First Rank in my program. During my final year, I developed a project called Blind Assistant, which was selected among the Top 100 Innovative Projects in Mumbai at the CIIA Competition. That early recognition encouraged me to pursue a career in tech. After graduation, I joined ITD Services Pvt. Ltd. as a Software Developer, where I worked from May 2022 to July 2024. My role involved full-stack development on their in-house SaaS product, where I contributed to both front-end and back-end modules to ensure performance and scalability. One of my key responsibilities included building an export module that handled large-scale data processing and formatting. While working, I realized the need to stay updated, so I resigned to upskill myself and enrolled in Scaler Academy. Within 6 months, I earned the Top 1% Learner badge and have completed certifications in JavaScript, React, and full MERN stack development. On the project side, I’ve built: A portfolio website using React + Tailwind CSS (ganesharwat.in), A real-time video calling app using WebRTC and Socket.IO, A movie search & watchlist app using OMDb API and React, And other hands-on projects that strengthened my front-end and back-end integration skills. I’m now looking for a role that allows me to apply my backend expertise, especially in PHP and Laravel, while continuing to grow as a full-stack developer in a collaborative team.`

#### 2. why
`That's a good question! I’ve actually worked with both — PHP in the form of CodeIgniter and Laravel, and MERN stack through my personal projects and Scaler training. The reason I chose this PHP Laravel role is that I have professional experience building and maintaining a SaaS product using PHP, and I’m confident in delivering reliable back-end solutions with it. Laravel, in particular, offers a very clean structure, excellent documentation, and powerful features like Eloquent ORM, authentication scaffolding, and task queues that I enjoy working with. At the same time, my front-end knowledge with React and JavaScript gives me an edge in full-stack scenarios, so I can contribute across the board when needed. In short, I see this PHP Laravel opportunity as a space where I can apply my real-world experience immediately while keeping my full-stack skills active for cross-functional development. I believe what matters most is delivering value, and I’m confident I can do that best with the tech stack I’ve already worked with in a production environment.`

### 3. Why did you choose web development?

`I’ve always been fascinated by the way technology shapes user experiences. Web development lets me blend creativity with logic—building interactive, visually appealing interfaces while solving real-world problems. Plus, it’s always evolving, which keeps me motivated to learn more every day.`

### 4. Why are you applying for this role?

`I believe this role aligns perfectly with my skill set and career goals. It offers the opportunity to work on real-world projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and grow in a professional environment. I’m confident that I can contribute value while learning and evolving as a developer.`

## ✅ Soft Skills / Personality Evaluation Questions

### 5. What are your strengths?

`One of my key strengths is consistency. Whether it's coding daily or staying disciplined during learning, I stay committed to progress. I'm also a fast learner—when I started JavaScript, I built DOM projects within weeks. And I genuinely enjoy collaborating in teams and helping others grow.`

### 6. What’s your weakness?

` I used to struggle with time management, especially while multitasking multiple learning paths. But I started using Notion and a daily planner to organize my learning schedule, and it’s helped me become much more focused and productive.`

### 7. How do you handle failure or criticism?

`I take failures and criticism as opportunities to grow. For example, during a portfolio review, I was advised to improve responsiveness. I took that feedback seriously, studied responsive design deeply, and improved my layout significantly. Feedback is just a guide to become better.`

### 8. How do you handle pressure or tight deadlines?

` I stay calm and break the task into small actionable steps. When I'm under pressure, I prioritize based on impact and deadlines. During my certificate course, we had back-to-back deadlines, and I handled it by blocking distraction time and keeping focus with mini goals.`

### 9. Describe a time you worked in a team.

`During my internship and training phase, I collaborated on a web-based project where I handled frontend UI, another teammate managed backend. We used GitHub for version control and communicated frequently to stay aligned. It was a great experience working with a team and learning from each other.`

### 10. What motivates you?

`The excitement of solving a problem and seeing it work in real-time is a huge motivator. Also, seeing how technology can impact users positively makes me want to keep learning and building meaningful things.`

### 11. Where do you see yourself in 3–5 years?

`I see myself as a full-stack developer contributing to large-scale applications, possibly mentoring juniors, and maybe even building a product of my own. I want to keep upgrading technically while also becoming a better communicator and team player.`

### 12. Tell me about a challenge you faced and how you solved it.

`One challenge was optimizing a slow-loading JavaScript-based project. I researched async loading, reduced DOM manipulation, and minimized asset sizes. After applying these techniques, performance improved noticeably. This taught me a lot about real-world debugging.`

### 13. How do you stay updated with tech trends?

`I follow tech YouTube channels, blogs like CSS-Tricks and MDN, and I'm part of online dev communities on Discord and Reddit. I also regularly explore GitHub projects to learn from other developers’ code.`

### 14. Do you prefer working alone or in a team?

`I enjoy both. When I work alone, I dive deep into code and learn. But in a team, I get to see different perspectives, learn faster, and build stronger solutions. I think the best learning happens in collaboration.`

### 15. What do you do in your free time?

`Apart from coding and learning new tech, I enjoy watching inspiring tech talks, taking walks to refresh my mind, and sometimes exploring UI/UX trends. I also help other learners in dev communities which reinforces my own learning.`
