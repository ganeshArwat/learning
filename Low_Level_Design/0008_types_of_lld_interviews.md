## **Types of LLD Interviews (What REALLY Happens)**

> Companies don’t test LLD in one way.
> They test **how you think under different constraints**.

Most candidates fail because they **prepare for the wrong format**.

---

## 1️⃣ The 3 Common Types of LLD Interviews

### 1. **Machine Coding Round**

### 2. **LLD Design Discussion**

### 3. **Code Review / Refactoring Round**

You may face **one or all** of these.

---

## 2️⃣ Type 1: Machine Coding Round

### What It Is

* Time-bound (60–120 mins)
* You write **actual code**
* Evaluated on:

  * Design
  * Readability
  * Extensibility

### What Interviewers Expect

* Clean class design
* SOLID principles
* Working code (but not perfect UI)

### Typical Questions

* Parking Lot
* Snake & Ladder
* LRU Cache
* Tic Tac Toe
* Vending Machine

---

### ❌ Common Mistakes

* Jumping straight into coding
* No class diagram
* God classes
* No extensibility

---

### ✅ Senior Strategy (THIS IS GOLD)

**First 10–15 mins:**

* Clarify requirements
* Write class names on paper

**Next 20 mins:**

* Define responsibilities
* Decide relationships

**Last 60 mins:**

* Code cleanly
* Refactor if time allows

💡 Say this out loud:

> “I’ll start with a basic version and evolve it.”

---

## 3️⃣ Type 2: LLD Design Discussion

### What It Is

* Whiteboard / shared editor
* Mostly **design**, minimal code
* Heavy focus on thinking

### What Interviewers Look For

* How you break down requirements
* How you handle changes
* How you justify decisions

### Typical Questions

* Design Splitwise
* Design Elevator
* Design Chat App
* Design URL Shortener (LLD view)

---

### ❌ Common Mistakes

* Over-detailing
* Jumping to patterns too early
* Ignoring edge cases

---

### ✅ Senior Strategy

Structure your answer:

1. Clarify requirements
2. Identify core entities
3. Define responsibilities
4. Discuss relationships
5. Handle extensions

Say:

> “Let’s first agree on the core objects.”

---

## 4️⃣ Type 3: Code Review / Refactoring Round

### What It Is

* Given messy code
* Asked to:

  * Identify issues
  * Improve design
  * Refactor

### What Interviewers Test

* Smell detection
* Refactoring skill
* Communication

### Typical Tasks

* Break God class
* Reduce duplication
* Improve naming
* Introduce interfaces

---

### ❌ Common Mistakes

* Rewriting everything
* Changing behavior
* Being silent while refactoring

---

### ✅ Senior Strategy

Always explain:

> “I’ll start by extracting responsibilities without changing behavior.”

This calms interviewers instantly.

## 5️⃣ How Companies Map Experience Levels

| Level   | Expectation            |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| 0–2 yrs | Working code           |
| 2–4 yrs | Clean structure        |
| 4–6 yrs | Extensible design      |
| 6+ yrs  | Trade-offs & evolution |

You’re aiming for **4–6 year level answers**.

---

## 6️⃣ Preparation Strategy (VERY PRACTICAL)

### For Machine Coding

* Practice 90-min sessions
* Focus on class design first

### For Design Discussion

* Practice explaining aloud
* Draw class diagrams

### For Refactoring

* Take messy code and improve it weekly

---

## 7️⃣ PRACTICE (DO THIS NOW)

### 🧪 Exercise 1

For **Parking Lot**:

* What type of LLD round is it usually?
* How would you approach it?

---

### 🧪 Exercise 2

You’re given a **God class** in interview:

* What is your first sentence to interviewer?

---

## 🔚 Key Takeaway

> **LLD interviews test thinking, not typing speed.**
