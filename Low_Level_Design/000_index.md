# 🔥 COMPLETE LOW-LEVEL DESIGN (LLD) MASTER ROADMAP

**Target:** 3–5 years experience | Backend / Full-Stack | Interview-Ready
**Languages:** PHP (primary), JavaScript (secondary)

---

## 🧠 PHASE 0 – ENGINEERING MINDSET (FOUNDATION)

### Goals

* Think like a designer, not a coder
* Understand what “good design” actually means

### Topics

* What is good vs bad design
* Design trade-offs (simplicity vs extensibility)
* Code smells (God class, tight coupling, duplication)
* Refactoring fundamentals
* Writing readable & maintainable code

### Practice

* Take messy procedural PHP code → refactor to clean OOP
* Identify and fix code smells

---

## 📘 PHASE 1 – LLD BASICS

### Topics

* What is Low Level Design
* LLD vs HLD
* Types of LLD interviews

  * Machine coding
  * Design discussion
  * Refactoring round
* How interviewers evaluate LLD answers

### Practice

* Explain LLD vs HLD in your own words
* Analyze 2–3 real interview LLD questions

---

## 🧩 PHASE 2 – OOP FUNDAMENTALS

### Topics

* Classes & Objects
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Interfaces
* Enums
* Object lifecycle
* Immutability

### Practice

* Design: User, Order, Product, Cart
* Implement same design in:

  * PHP
  * JavaScript (ES6 classes)
* Avoid inheritance unless absolutely needed

---

## 🔗 PHASE 3 – CLASS RELATIONSHIPS

### Topics

* Association
* Aggregation
* Composition
* Dependency
* Realization
* Cardinality (1-1, 1-many)
* Ownership rules
* Composition vs Inheritance (CRITICAL)

### Practice

* Design relationships for:

  * Library system
  * E-commerce order flow
* Redesign using composition where possible

---

## 🎯 PHASE 4 – DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Topics

* DRY
* KISS
* YAGNI
* Law of Demeter
* Separation of Concerns
* Coupling & Cohesion
* Favor Composition over Inheritance
* Fail Fast Principle

### Practice

* Identify violations in existing code
* Refactor code to improve cohesion & reduce coupling

---

## 🧱 PHASE 5 – SOLID PRINCIPLES (CORE LLD)

### Topics

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Open/Closed Principle
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle
* SOLID violations & refactoring

### Practice

* Break SOLID rules intentionally
* Refactor to SOLID
* Implement examples in PHP & JS

---

## 📐 PHASE 6 – UML (JUST ENOUGH)

### Focus Areas

* Class Diagrams ⭐⭐⭐
* Sequence Diagrams ⭐⭐⭐
* Use Case Diagrams
* Activity Diagrams

### Practice

* Draw diagrams before coding
* Convert diagrams → code

---

## 🧰 PHASE 7 – DESIGN PATTERNS

### How to Study Each Pattern

* Problem
* Bad design
* Pattern solution
* When NOT to use it

---

### Creational Patterns

* Singleton
* Factory Method
* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype

### Structural Patterns

* Adapter
* Facade
* Decorator
* Composite
* Proxy
* Bridge
* Flyweight

### Behavioral Patterns

* Strategy
* Observer
* Iterator
* Command
* State
* Template Method
* Chain of Responsibility
* Mediator
* Memento
* Visitor

### Additional Patterns

* MVC
* Repository
* Dependency Injection
* Null Object
* Specification
* Producer Consumer
* Thread Pool
* Game Loop

### Practice

* Implement patterns in PHP
* Apply patterns inside real systems (not standalone)

---

## ⚡ PHASE 8 – CONCURRENCY & PERFORMANCE

### Topics

* Thread safety concepts
* Locks vs lock-free ideas
* Rate limiting strategies
* Caching (LRU, TTL)
* Performance vs memory trade-offs

### Practice

* Design LRU Cache
* Design Rate Limiter
* Design Logging Framework

---

## 🧪 PHASE 9 – ERROR HANDLING & EXTENSIBILITY

### Topics

* Exception handling strategy
* Logging levels
* Retry mechanisms
* Idempotency
* Extensible system design

### Practice

* Add retry + logging to existing designs

---

## 🧠 PHASE 10 – LLD INTERVIEW STRATEGY

### Topics

* How to approach LLD questions
* Asking clarifying questions
* Incremental design approach
* How to explain design clearly
* Common interview mistakes

---

## 🏗️ PHASE 11 – LLD INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (PRACTICE)

### Easy

* Tic Tac Toe
* Snake & Ladder
* Parking Lot
* LRU Cache
* Notification System

### Medium

* ATM
* Splitwise
* Elevator
* Chat Application
* URL Shortener
* Payment Gateway
* Rate Limiter

### Hard

* Spotify
* Amazon
* LinkedIn
* Food Delivery System
* Ride Hailing Service
* In-Memory File System
* Task Scheduler

### Rule

> Requirements → Classes → UML → Code → Refactor

---

## 🎯 FINAL OUTCOME

After this roadmap, you will:

* Design scalable systems
* Write clean, extensible code
* Confidently explain trade-offs
* Clear LLD interviews at product companies
